Completely Negative -:- Last week, I went to this really bad place downtown Abu Dhabi. The food was garbage and the staff were honestly the worst. The place is not even worth rating. I just hope they go down soon.
Completely Positive -:- The new KARS outlet down the road is absolutely amazing. The food is great and in budget suprisingly. You get these amazing deals on every fridays. The service is really fast and fit for a fast food restaurant. Would recommend strongly.
Neutral -:- I really loved the customer service. I got a table almost immediately, but sadly the food was not too good.
